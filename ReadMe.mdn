# Setup Instructions

## Prerequisites:

1. Node.js (v22.4.1) installed on your system

2. npm (Node Package Manager) installed along with Node.js

3. Install dependencies:
    `npm install`
4. Set up environment variables:

    * Create a .env file in the root directory of the project.

    * Add the following environment variables:

        1. PORT=3003

        2. DB_CONNECTION_STRING=your-database-connection-string

5. Start the development server:

    * nodmon app

    * The application should now be running on http://localhost:3003.

## Technology Stack

The login and registration system is built using the following technology stack:

**Backend:**

Language: Node.js (JavaScript)

Framework: Express.js

Database: MongoDB (using Mongoose for data modeling and querying)

**Frontend:**

Language: HTML, JavaScript

Styling: CSS

## Code Structure and Design Decisions

 The project is structured as follows:
````
login-registration-system/
│   ├── views/
│   │   ├── login.js
│   │   ├── Register.js
│   │   └── dashBoard.js
│   ├── public/
│   └── script.js
│   └── stylesheet.css
├──models/
│      └── user.js
├── app.js 
├── package.json
└── README.md
````
## Design Decisions

**Backend:**

* Express.js: A popular and lightweight web framework for Node.js, providing a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

* MongoDB and Mongoose: MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database, and Mongoose is an Object Document Mapping (ODM) library that provides a higher-level abstraction for interacting with the database.

## Code Structure

* The project is divided into two main directories: client and server.

* The client directory contains all the  components and the entry point for the frontend application.

* The app.js contains the backend code, including the Express.js application

* The models folder contains the models and user schema.

This separation of concerns between the client and server allows for better maintainability, scalability, and potential future decoupling of the frontend and backend.

## Assumptions and Limitations

**Authentication:**

* The implementation assumes a simple email/password-based authentication system. More advanced authentication methods, such as social login, two-factor authentication, or integration with external identity providers, are not included in this basic implementation.

**Error Handling:**

* The error handling in this implementation is basic and may not cover all possible error scenarios. In a production-ready application, more comprehensive error handling and user feedback would be necessary.

**Data Validation:**

* The validation of user inputs (username, email, phone number) is basic and may not cover all edge cases, But it consists of:

**Password Security:**

In this implementation, the passwords are stored hashed and salted using a secure algorithm, such as bcrypt.

**Database Integration:**

The implementation assumes a MongoDB database connection.

**Styling and UI:**

The UI is implemented using a CSS framework. In a production-ready application, more comprehensive styling, responsive design, and accessibility considerations would be necessary.
